# Battleship
A project originally developed for a object oriented programming course teached by [Ivan Mathias Filho](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/blog/professor/@ivan-mathias-filho) at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, implemented in Java, with the help of the GUI widget toolkit, Swing. The entire project was developed with Eclipse, in 1024x768 resolution.

## Game Rules

### Starting a new game
Upon opening the game, the players will be met with a menu, in which they are able to choose to play a new game, load a previously played game or exit back to the desktop. Upon starting a new game, the players are required to inform their names, so they can be identified further in the match.

### Positioning Phase
Upon starting a game, both players must choose where to position their ships. Each one must position all ships to advance to the next phase. Player 1 goes first, while Player 2 looks away. Then Player 2 places his/her ships, while Player 1 looks away. The rules for placing ships are the following:
* The player cannot place ships outside the borders
* The player cannot place ships directly adjacent or diagonally to other ships

### Attack Phase
In this phase, players take turns attacking each other. While one player attacks, the other looks away. For every turn, the player has 3 attacks available. If a player hits all the parts of a ship, it is considered sunk. Once a player sinks every ship of his adversary, he wins the game.
